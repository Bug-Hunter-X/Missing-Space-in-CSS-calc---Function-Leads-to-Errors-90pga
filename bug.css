The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if there is a missing space between the operator and its operands, it will lead to unexpected behavior or parsing errors. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px);` will cause issues. The correct form is `width:calc(100% - 10px);`.
